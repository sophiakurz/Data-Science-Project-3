claimed that Black patients were more susceptible to getting Heart disease than white people. We decided from there that we wanted to examine different facets of this claim, including the mortality rate. From there, we downloaded an Excel spreadsheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that took a sample size of over 10 million individuals who suffer from different chronic illnesses in the United States and split it into further variables (outcome, ethnicity, etc). We decided to organize the spreadsheet in such a way that sorted the chronic illnesses to heart disease and ethnicities to “white, non-Hispanic” and “African-American, non-Hispanic”. From there, we separated these values and examined the outcomes. We hypothesized that the mortality rate for Black individuals with heart disease was greater than the mortality rate for white individuals, due also to the fact that Black Americans die at a higher rate than white Americans in hospital settings. We expected our hypothesis to be correct.

We did a statistical analysis called a Chi-square test, which compares two categorical values and determines if there is a relationship between the two variables. We did this by creating a table of observed counts, expected counts, the actual chi-square statistical calculations, calculating the chi-square statistic and chi-square critical, and p-value. We compared these values to make our determination.
